# Sails Winston Logger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UzEE/sails-hook-winston-logger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UzEE/sails-hook-winston-logger)

A custom Sails.js hook to add support for logging using the popular Winston library. Currently, the module comes with out of the box support for the following trasports:

* Console (will automatically be activated by default)
* DailyRotateFile (based on Winston's [DailyRotateFile](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/blob/master/docs/transports.md#dailyrotatefile-transport))
* AWS CloudWatch (based on LazyWithClass's [Winston CloudWatch](https://github.com/lazywithclass/winston-cloudwatch))

## Installation
Make sure you have at least Sails.js version v0.12.0 installed.

```ssh
npm install sails-hook-winstonlogger --save
```

## Usage
Like all other Sails.js hooks, this module will be instantiaed automatically when the Sails server lifts. It will configure Sails' default [Captain's Log](https://github.com/balderdashy/captains-log) to use a custom logger.

You can control what logging transports are available by creating a config file called ```config/winstonlogger.js```.

The default options are shown below, and you only need to include the keys you want to change in your custom config file.

You will have to provide a ```logGroupName``` and a ```logStreamName``` if you are planning to use the ```CloudWatch``` transport. 

```js
module.exports.winstonlogger = {

	console: {
		enabled: true,
		level: 'info',
		timestamp: true,
		colorize: true,
		prettyPrint: true
	},

	dailyRotate: {
		enabled: false,
		level: 'info',
		filename: path.join(path.dirname(path.resolve('package.json')), 'logs', pkgJSON.name + '.log.'),
		timestamp: true,
		colorize: false,
		maxsize: 1024 * 1024 * 10,
		json: true,
		prettyPrint: true,
		depth: 10,
		tailable: true,
		zippedArchive: true,
		datePattern: 'yyyy-MM-dd'
	},

	cloudWatch: {
		enabled: false,
		logGroupName: null,
		logStreamName: null,
		awsAccessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
		awsSecretKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
		awsRegion: process.env.AWS_REGION
	}
}
```
